# Flight_Planner
A C++ project designed to optimize flight schedules by minimizing travel costs or achieving the earliest possible arrival time. This system efficiently computes optimal routes while considering connection times and other constraints.

# Key Highlights:
<bt> Optimizes flight schedules based on cost or time.
<bt> Efficient route computation using Dijkstra and BFS algorithms.
<bt> Considers connection times and other realistic constraints.

#Tech Stack
Language: C++
Algorithms: Dijkstra, BFS
